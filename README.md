# TU Delft ENS Group MSc Thesis Template

This is a official repository for [TU Delft Embedded Networked Systems Group](http://www.ens.ewi.tudelft.nl) MSc Thesis Template.

### How to use this template

Assuming you have LaTeX installed and any Unix-compatible system, simply type

```
make
```

This will compile the whole thesis (mege front pages with the core of the thesis and generate `thesis.pdf`). Makefile, which is part of this repository, specifies the following options in particular:

- `all`: calls this makefile `pdflatex` command
- `dvipdf`: calls this makefile `dvi` command and complies pdf file from dvi file
- `pdflatex`: complies `thesis.tex` with unix/linux `pdflatex` command
- `dvi`: complies `thesis.tex` with unix/linux `latex` command
- `spell`: run `aspell` command (linux spell checking command) over all `.tex` files
- `view`: calls this makefile `pdflatex` command and then [GNOME Evince Document Viewer](https://help.gnome.org/users/evince/stable/)
- `clean`: removes all ancillary files from the `work` directory

### Using this template with Overleaf

To use this template with overleaf fork this repository and import it to overleaf. If you face issues with rendering the ENS logo, compile the tud-ens-logo.tex file and place the generated image (.pdf) in the required location (template-pics/tud-ens-logo-tikz). Make sure you start editing with the thesis.tex file with your name, thesis title etc.

### History

This template is an adapted LaTeX thesis template of the old TU Delft Embedded Systems Group (see example [here](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A6d5a3afd-1966-4357-b063-7a82c0fdb0ab)). That template was again adapted from the MSc thesis template of the [Parallel (and then Distributed) Systems group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/distributed-systems/) at TU Delft.
