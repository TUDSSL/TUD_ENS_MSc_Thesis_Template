Important rules for typesetting bibliography:

- Consistency: __all__ references must be typeset following the same style. Therefore, if one reference lists all authors---all other must as well, if one reference lists address of the conference---all other conference publications must list it as well; if one conference is named by the abbreviation---all other must be as well (exception to the rule is when you cite a conference which is not well known), etc. 
- no et al.: please list __all___ authors of a publication
- time: typesetting clear and __complete__ reference file takes time (unfortunately). However, good presentation makes your thesis pleasant to read!
- abbreviate journal titles if possible: IEEE has a official list of IEEE journal abbreviations (http://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/Journal-Titles-and-Abbreviations.pdf) while ACM does; However you can quickly check on the ACM journal website what the official abbreviation is
- do not copy bibtex files blindly---typeset it yourself: ACM- and IEEE-generated bibtex files contain many inconsistencies, therefore you would have to type these references yourself. Below you will find a reasonably good designed list of most popular reference types. Use them as a boilerplate and replace these fields from a bibfile you downloaded from the internet
- abbreviate months: bibtex can replace three letter month name with the right one---do not put these names in curly brackets 
- abbreviations in curly brackets: in titles abbreviations must be placed in curly brackets
- capitalize titles: always
